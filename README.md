# Library.py

For this assignment I was particularly working with strings without relying on built-in string methods. By designing and implementing a custom library with specific functions for character and string manipulation. This assignment teaches you concepts like conditional logic, loops, and ASCII encoding. The assignment also included parameter handling and return values, which builds strong foundational skills in programming. 



# These are some functions in the assignment 
*is_alpha 

*is_digit 

*to_lower 

*to_upper
